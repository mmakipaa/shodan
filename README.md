# Shodan - Aikido Technique Practice Application

A [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) application designed to help Aikido practitioners prepare for graduation examinations by rehearsing technique recall and recognition through randomized audio prompts.

## About

Shodan simulates a grading examination by presenting individual Aikido techniques in a random order. The technique is announced out loud, and the user can visualize and mentally practice the technique before moving to the next one.

The application was developed as an experiment in AI-assisted software development, combining human architectural direction with AI-powered tools for implementation and voice generation.

## Features

- Randomized technique playback from a collection of 145 Aikido techniques
- Audio prompts for visualization-based learning
- Filtering by kyu level (1-6)
- Multiple grading source support:
  - [Aikikai Finland](https://www.aikidoliitto.fi) (official federation requirement list, 69 techniques)
  - [AikiCircle](https://www.aikicircle.fi) requirements (73 techniques)
  - Option to include 58 additional techniques not in either organization's kyu requirements
- Progress saved in browser's local storage to continue where you left off
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use

## How It Works

Users choose their desired kyu levels and curriculum source. The application then creates a randomized playlist from the selected techniques and presents them one by one. Once all techniques have been presented, the list is shuffled again. User selections and progress are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing practice sessions to resume from where they left off â€” assuming browser privacy settings permit data retention.

Technique data is stored in `techniques.json`, which maps each technique to its attributes and corresponding audio file.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project was created over a couple of days as an experiment in AI-assisted coding. The code was not simply generated by AI but created through a collaborative process with human guidance focusing on architectural decisions. The development focused on:

- Creating a robust application architecture with proper data models
- Implementing state management with local storage persistence
- Building a responsive UI for technique visualization
- Generating audio prompts with AI voice synthesis

The initial project environment was set up manually following the official Vue.js [quick start guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html) prior to beginning the AI-assisted development process.

AI-assisted development used the following tools: **VSCode** as the code editor, **GitHub Copilot (in agent mode)** for code suggestions and workflow with **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** as LLM.

The audio files were generated from text using OpenAI's [GPT-4o mini TTS](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini-tts).

## Development

This project is built in Typescript with Vue 3 and [Vite](https://vite.dev). The architecture follows a store-based pattern using [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org) for state management.

### Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

```sh
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to any static hosting service:

1. Run `npm run build` to generate production files
2. The files in the `dist` directory can be deployed to your hosting service

Note: This application is configured with a base path of `/shodan/` for production. Adjust the `base` setting in `vite.config.ts` if needed for your hosting environment.
